## FAQ

### Why did I write this?

After running through the agony of starting express, http, https, and socket.io servers from scratch a few dozen times, I decided that there had to be a better way to combine all of these powerful technologies together in a non-stupid manner.  

So, I set off to write a simple micro-framework to put everything together into one simple, elegant and high performance library.

### Do all of the examples work?

Yes, I went through and painstakingly tested all of the examples.  Almost all of them can be copy-pasted directly from the docs.

I take the examples in this project very seriously.  If you run into any problems, then please file an issue.

### Is this a drop-in replacement for express?

Yes, with the caveat that you are using a compatible version of express to the one express.io is using. Currently, express@3.x should just work as a replacement.

### Is it ready for production?

Yes, we have been using it in production without issue.
